///         halvings), and distributes the result across farm pools by allocation points with O(1) lazy
///         accounting. Only pools' farms can pull minted CHEESE, and only for emission accrued while they
///         were enabled.
///
///         Emission model (mirrors SqueekMining):
///           - `activate()` schedules the start at the next full SqueekCore round (startRound = current + 1).
///           - The first checkpoint that sees round startRound-1 certified records the completed height at
///             that round as h0. Blocks at or below h0 never emit (no retroactive minting).
///           - Each checkpoint prices `issued(height - h0) - issued(lastHeight - h0)` in O(1), clipped to the
///             remaining allowance, so delayed checkpoints, halving crossings and large jumps all settle
///             exactly, and zero block movement emits zero.
///           - Only the share belonging to enabled pools is ever minted. The Future Pool Reserve (points not
///             assigned to an enabled pool) stays unminted; its historical emission is never redistributed.
///
///         Weight changes checkpoint first, settle the affected pools under the old weights, and apply
///         prospectively. Pools and depositors can never receive emission accrued before their eligibility.
