///         CHEESE reward accounting fed by CheeseEmissionController, and the Hamster Bite withdrawal fee.
///
///         Principal:   deposits mint shares at the current assets-per-share (0% fee). Withdrawals burn
///                      shares immediately (no cooldown). 15% of the gross assets backing the burned shares
///                      is the Hamster Bite: 85% goes to the withdrawer, 14% stays in the farm (raising
///                      assets per share for everyone remaining), 1% goes to the Treasury. If no shares
///                      remain, the whole 15% goes to the Treasury. The retained share is capped at what
///                      the remaining stake will itself return to the Treasury on exit (15/85 of the
///                      assets backing the remaining shares); the excess goes to the Treasury now. A stake
///                      placed just before a dominant exit can therefore never inherit more than its own
///                      Hamster Bite, so front-running an exit is never profitable and the Treasury is
///                      never short of the 15% once that stake leaves.
///         Rewards:     claimed separately from principal. The farm pulls the pool's accrued CHEESE from the
///                      controller before any share change, so new depositors never see earlier emission;
///                      if the farm has no eligible shares, the controller forfeits the accrual instead of
///                      minting it. Emission reaches the farm in chunks (one per Reporter certification),
///                      so shares deposited since the last pull that priced new Squeek blocks wait for the
///                      next priced pull before they earn: a deposit mined just ahead of a certification
///                      earns nothing from it. Principal is never delayed by this.
///         Reserves:    `totalAssets` (principal), `rewardReserve` (minted CHEESE) and `treasuryOwed` (fees
///                      the Treasury could not receive) are tracked internally and never read from balances,
///                      so donations cannot move the share price or be mistaken for rewards. The CHEESE farm
///                      holds all three in one token; the invariant
///                      balance >= totalAssets + rewardReserve + treasuryOwed always holds and surplus is
///                      skimmable only to the Treasury.
///         Treasury:    its share is pushed with a bounded gas stipend. If the push fails (a receiver that
///                      reverts, has no receive function or burns the stipend) the amount is credited to
///                      `treasuryOwed` and paid later through `payTreasury()`, so a withdrawer's 85% never
///                      depends on the Treasury accepting funds.
